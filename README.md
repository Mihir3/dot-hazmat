This repository is the code base for the paper [**DOT-HAZMAT: An Android Application for Detection of Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Signs**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4111847) presented at Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Innovations and Research in Technology and Engineering (ICIRTE-2022), organized by VPPCOE & VA, Mumbai-22, INDIA.

In this research, we proposed a YOLOv5-CNN pipeline built in Pytorch and deployed via Tensorflow lite on an Android application to detect HAZMAT signs from 13 different classes. This was done to help first responders and rescue teams proceed with safety operations efficiently. The detection of HAZMAT signs at the early stages of disaster management operations would also further limit the impact of hazardous materials on the environment and people around them.

We would like to acknowledge that the code behind our prototype Android application to demonstrate the implementation of object detection techniques for HAZMAT signs is built on top of the [**tf-android**](https://github.com/zldrobit/yolov5) branch forked by Jiacong Fang from the original [**YOLOv5 Ultralytics repository**](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) authored by Glenn Jocher.
